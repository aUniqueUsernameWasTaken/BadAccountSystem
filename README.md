# Hello!
## About
This is an incredibly bad account managment system, atleast i think so. I never really made an account system like this.
## Setup
Just clone it. (`git clone <link>`)
`cd` into the cloned director.
then.
### On Linux and Mac:
run:
`bash main.sh`
### On Windows:
run:
`clear & python main.py`
