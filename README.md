# Hello!
## About
This is an incredibly bad account managment system, atleast i think so. I never really made an account system like this.
## Setup
Just clone it. (`git clone <link>`)\
`cd` into the cloned directory.\
then:
### Linux and Mac:
run:
`bash main.sh`
### Windows:
run:
`python main.py`
## 'Features'
This isnt fully meant for security, ofcourse there are security flaws. or just flaws straight up. if someone willed it they could go into the
`account/` directory and just straight up delete all the accounts. 
But all the accounts usernames and passwords are stored in sha256 hash. so i guess that is some sort of wall of security. assuming you can fix
all the other holes. 
## Chalange
find out the password and username of the account preset in the.. account directory. heh\
if you find the correct account.. good job i guess.
